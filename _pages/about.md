I’m a biomedical engineer with a passion for medical imaging, innovation, and research that translates into real-world impact. I recently completed my MASc in Biomedical Engineering at McMaster University, where my thesis focused on evaluating the repeatability of advanced diffusion MRI metrics using a novel anisotropic phantom. My work involved technical MRI acquisition, data processing, and statistical reproducibility analysis.

I bring a unique blend of research experience, hands-on technical skills, and a strong foundation in both biomedical and electrical engineering. I’ve contributed to projects at the Hospital for Sick Children and McMaster’s Imaging Research Centre. I’ve also served as a head teaching assistant, where I supported engineering education and led administrative coordination for a 300+ student course.

I’m especially excited by roles at the intersection of imaging science, R&D, and knowledge translation. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to advance the future of healthcare.
